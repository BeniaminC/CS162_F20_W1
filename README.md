# LAB1 - Coding Sample for Introduction to Computer Science II (CS 162).

Code examples are supplement to the lectures and labs.

Skills:
- Structs (declaring and instantiating)
- Pointers (and how they relate to parameters and arrays)
- Basic concepts of the stack and the heap
- functions (passing by value and passing by reference)
- Scoping
- Allocating and freeing memory (raw pointers)
- Basic makefiles
- Basic error checking and validation
- Test tables (good, bad, and edge cases)

if you don't understand these concept, you should ask for help by going to office hours.

NOTE:Some concepts may be extensions to lectures and labs (i.e. modern style C++ programming).
